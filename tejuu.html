<td><p align="justify">to make idli four parts uncooked rice (idli rice or parboiled rice)to one part whole lentil (black gram vigma mungo)are soaked separately for at least four hours to six hours or overnight optionally spices 
such as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking for additional flavour once done soaking the letils are ground to a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground then they are combined next the mixture is
 left to ferment overnight during which its volume will more than double after fermentation same of the batter may be kept as a starter culture for the next batch the finished idli batter is put into greased moulds of an
 idli tray or "tree" for steaming the perforated molds allow the idlis to be cooked evenly the trees holds the trays above the levelof boiling water in a pot and the pot is covered until the idils are done (about 10-25 minutes
 depending on size)more traditional method is to use leaves instead of moulds</p></td>
